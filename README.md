# Palindromes

An implementation of [Manacher algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring) algorithm to find plaindromes.

A palindrome may be odd or even in length.
* Even length palindroms have their centre *between* a pair of characters. e.g.
|---|---|---|
| A |   | B |
|---|---|---|
|   | â†‘ |   |
|---|---|---|
